# Pomodoro Timer
A Pomodoro style timer I wrote while not using the Pomodoro technique :)

### What is the Pomodoro technique?
The Pomodoro technique is a time management technique to use while working on difficult/boring tasks, such as studying. The method involves alternating between 'work' and 'break' periods of set times. The break periods help break up the monotony of your task, and give your brain a chance to recover.

### How does this app help?
This app allows users to set their desired work and break times with a simple, easy to use interface. At the end of an interval, the app will vibrate to signify a switch.
